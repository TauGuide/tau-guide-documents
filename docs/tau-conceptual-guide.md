TAU - Whitepaper

by Dr Avishy Carmi

**NEEDS EDITING**
Tau is a decentralised, self amending platform technology that allows a computer program to change based on the collective decision of it’s many users.
Tau can do many things. The corse bases for such a system, It sounds like you have a system that can do anything for you.
On the surface it is a social chose platform. Bu the the social choice and the scaling of the discussion really come to support the aspect of collaboration and the aspect of collaboration come to support the core thing which self amendment or change. So, we can say that basically reality change is the only constant and her the same we have a system and part of the system are the user and the system should change all theme. Now, this leads, as we now, this implies recursion and if the system is complete then this leads to paradoxes. 
The idea behind tau is that based on axioms of the system which I am going to provide in a minute it basically delineates a specific logic that avoids the paradoxes of self reference.
The law of laws, the idea is that you have three axioms that allows you to realise the tau system and these axioms are:
recursion
retraction
decidability
Recursion talks about law of changing laws. You have a law and you want to change it so you need a law of i11 and so on. Eventually you come up with idea that you need an unbounded recursion now this is the first axiom.
Retraction - Perhaps when a law is not applicable or is not realisable or is not moral, etc. you wish to restrict it. This implies that you live in a normal atomic world and this is what we talk about being in a non monotonic logic so you would like to retract the law.

Decidability - eventually we would like to get a verdict.whether this law give you the value that it promised and eventually you would like to turn it into an action so system needs to be decidable. so this free axiom delineates in a particular logic
The recursion tells us that we need a fixed point in the logic. Then we have the retraction says that ok it’s supposed to also be monotonic so this leads us to something like partial fixed point and eventually we have decidability and that taels you that the logic is supposed to be definable on finance structures.

Okay so we come to the point we know that we are supposed to have partial fixed point on finance structures and this is essentially what TML is doing. Now, recently we thought about perhaps looking from different angle and then we basically formulated a calculus of laws, we are still working on it . Its in preparation and the calculus of morals. Now morals are and laws are 2 different things. My morals are about what is right and what is wrong. Laws are basically social agreements. Eventually we know that in our world people have traded laws for morals and morals for laws and perhaps more of the latter than former. 
Whats tau is about is basically if everything will work fine in the system and you know we have the first users and the system can grow and evolve because of the self amendment thing and all of the logic we have, eventually we can get a system which morals equal laws. so if you take a look at the three axioms, We want to get free axioms from calculus of morals you will say the following thing:
For morals, for a thing to be moral you have to approach though negation which means you have to remove all that immoral from it so this corresponds with the law of retraction, the axiom of retraction.
The other thing is that if you wish to avo;ve and add more laws to the system then you would have decide when or not what you are to going to add is moral or not.
This basically corresponds to the second axiom of decidability and eventually you will have a lot of laws and some of the laws can be such that they will attest on their own morals and eventually you will get this self referential process again and you will like it to converge eventually and that means the law becomes a moral. Because when a moral attests to it’s own moral about being moral it will just the same. 
So this is just another way of looking for getting these three axioms.
eventually the system we are developing from theoretical aspect is a mathematical formal system so its supposed to be well defined with eh axioms and then all the conciquenses come over and then we eventually get the practical system that supposed to work.
Summary.
We are have assistants supposed to be self referential, self amending and yet eventually it will be a culture that will evolve and culture that reflects only it’slef and then evolves over time. This culture we have constituents which are the users that basically define the system. Now part of the system there is no duality in which you basically separate the users form the system and this whole thing is supposed to work and that means the users supposed to collaborate and discussed what are the laws that eventually will drive the system. For that they’ll need discussion. They will need a platform that will allow them to choose what to choose over which is we have nothing at the moment. No such system really exists at the moment. 
quorum:
what we are doing self reference in particular.
Tau is used to enlighten students,
A man decided to go stuffy with a master. He went to the door of the master. Who are you who wishes to study asked the master. The student told the master his name. That is not who you are.
