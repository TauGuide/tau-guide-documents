# TAU - Whitepaper

by Dr Avishy Carmi & Ohad Asor

## Introduction

Tau is a decentralised, self amending platform technology that allows a computer program to change based on the collective decision of it’s many users.
Tau can do many things. The core basis for such a system sounds like a system that can do anything for you.<br><br>
On the surface Tau is a social choice platform but the social choice and the scaling of the discussions really come to support the aspect of collaboration. The aspect of collaboration supports the core thing, which is self amendment or change.<br><br>

> We can basically say that in reality, change is perhaps the only constant.<br>With tau, we have the same. <br>

<br>We have a system. Part of that system are the users. The system should change all the time. Now, this leads to and implies recursion and if the system is complete then this leads to paradoxes. <br><br>

The idea behind tau, based on axioms of the system, basically delineates a specific logic that avoids the paradoxes of self reference.<br><br>

### The 3 law of laws

The idea is that you have three axioms that allow you to realise the tau system. These axioms are:

1. Recursion

2. Retraction

3. Decidability<br><br>

##### Recursion

We talk about law of changing laws. For instance, you have a law and you wish to change it. So you need a law of i11 and so on. Eventually you come up with idea that you need an unbounded recursion. now this is the first axiom.<br><bt>

**Retraction**

Perhaps when a law is not applicable or is not realisable or is not moral, etc. You wish to restrict it. This implies that you live in a non-monotomic world so using non-monotonic logic you'd like to retract the law.<br><br>

##### Decidability

Eventually, we would like to get a verdict and realise if this law gives the value that it promised. Eventually, we would like to turn it into an action so the system needs to be decidable. This third axiom delineates in a particular logic.<br><br>

With **Recursion** it tells us that we need a fixed point in the logic. **Retraction** says it’s supposed to also be monotonic. So this leads us to something like partial fixed point. Eventually we have **Decidability** and that tells you that the logic is supposed to be definable on finance structures.<br><br>

At this juncture, we know that we are supposed to have partial fixed point on finance structures. This is essentially what TML is doing. Recently, we thought about perhaps looking at it from different angle and then we basically formulated a calculus of laws, we are still working on it . Its in preparation and we refer to it as "the calculus of morals". <br>

Morals and laws are 2 different things. My morals are about what is right and what is wrong. Laws are basically social agreements. Eventually we know that in our world people have traded laws for morals and morals for laws and perhaps more of the latter than the former. <br>

The first users of the system can grow and evolve because of self amendment and all of the logic we have gathered from discussions; eventually we can get a system where morals equal laws. <br><br>

If you take a look at the three laws, we want to get the above free axioms from "calculus of morals" so one would say the following:<br>

Consider morals; for a thing to be moral you have to approach though negation which means you have to remove all that is immoral from it. This corresponds with the law or axiom of **Retraction**.<br>
The other thing is that if you wish to evolve and add more laws to the system then you would have to decide when or not what you are to going to add is moral or not.<br>

This basically corresponds to the second axiom of **Decidability** and eventually you will have a lot of laws and some of the laws can be such that they will attest on their own morals and eventually you will get this self referential process again and one would like it to converge eventually. That means the law becomes a moral. Because when a moral attests to it’s own moral about being moral it will just be the same. <br><br>

So this is just another way of looking for getting these three axioms.<br><br>

The system we are developing from a theoretical aspect is a mathematical formal system. Being well defined with the discussed axioms. The consequences of which will come, eventually producing the practical system. <br><br>

## Summary:

With Tau, we are have a system that aims to be self referential and self amending. Eventually, it will be a culture that will evolve. A culture that reflects on itself and evolves over time.<br>

In this culture there are constituents, the users that define the system. They are part of the system; there is no duality in which you separate the users from the system. This whole thing is designed to "walk", to grow. The users will collaborate and discuss what laws will eventually drive the system. For that they’ll need discussion. They will need a platform that will allow them to choose what to choose over. Currently, no such system really exists.
