# How to Store Agoras

> You may hold your Agoras in your [omni wallet](https://www.omniwallet.org/), or in any Bitcoin address to which you possess the private key such as a paper wallet.<br>
> If you use the latter method and wish to send Agoras out, you'll first have to [import your private key to Omni Wallet](https://www.notion.so/importyourprivatekey.Omni)
